-------------------------------

The parameter signature for the EpisodeAction constructor has been updated.
It now contains not only the optional "position" argument, but two new
arguments as well. The order of these parameters is:

  started
  position
  total

If one of "started" or "total" is set, "position" becomes mandatory. This
means that the following combinations are now possible:

  None
  position
  position and started
  position and total
  position and started and total

Also, the format has been changed. Instead of having a "HH:MM:SS" timestamp
format, we now only accept integer values (the number of seconds).
